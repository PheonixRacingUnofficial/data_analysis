# Data Analysis
> The data that we currently have is a mess full of extra/needless information </br>
## Reformatting 
Take in log file and separate the values by sensor </br>
Create a CSV file that separates each sensor into a column </br>
Ex: </br>
| Time (s) | MPPT1 Output Voltage (v) | MPPT1 Output Current (A) | ... |
| :------: | :----------------------: | :----------------------: | --- |
| 0        | 100                      | 5                        | ... |
| 1        | 98                       | 5                        | ... |

If there is missing data for that **second** put in the value of NaN </br>
Include separate columns for error trips from the BMU store 0 as False 1 as True </br>
This will allow us to see when an error has occcured and the behavior of the vehicle that lead up to it </br>
## Plotting
Create an individual plot for each column with respect to time </br>
Create a master plot that includes all columns with respect to time </br>
## Future
### Refactoring
As mentioned the log file is a mess and needs to be cleaned up </br>
The formating of every line is subject to change, a conversation needs to be had with **Chase** </br>
I personally would like future format to look something like: </br>
INFO:--file--:time:sensor val0:val1:val2:... </br>
The way speed is currently set up is rather convoluted and needs to be refactored </br>
As such, **ignore speed** for now; do not add speed on the csv file </br>
### Sensors
**Sensors will be not be within this log file ever** </br>
Theses will be on a separate system </br>
The format for ALL files will be the same so the parser should work everywhere </br>
### Implementation
> The following is what I think would be a good method to implement this </br>

<details>
	<summary>I highly recommend trying yourself first</summary>

	With the format of the logs, the time and sensor data can be retrived easily with some python functions </br>
	`python.split(' ')` will split the log info from the data </br>
	`python.split(':')` will split the data into a list </br>
	Getting the info is as simple as:

	``` python
	def get_line_info(line):
		log_info, data_info = line.split(' ')
		time = log_info[-2]
		sensor = log_info[-1]
		data = data_info.split (':')
		for item in data:
			print (item)
			# Do some task
		return info
	```

	There will be a data dictionary the explains what each of the values will mean **(Chase)** </br>
	You can use a dictionary to dynamically add new data buckets for the sensor data </br>
	Something like: </br>

	``` python
	sensor_dictionary = {}
	info = get_line_info(line)
	if not sensor_dictionary[info[0]]:
		sensor_dictionary[info[0]] = info[1:]
	```

	Note that this these blocks are mostly pseudo code and do not work 1-1 </br>
	This can be seen in the get_line_info function there is no variable info because that is something </br>
	you will create </br>

	Note that if this is a little confusing to look at, you can copy and paste this into markdown viewer </br>
	to see what it actuall would look like </br>
